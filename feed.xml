So I decided to stop being lazy and start today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is going to be a combination of posts about tech that I’m currently learning about, recipes that I’ve attempted (with pictures :D), places that I’ve recently visited, as well as anything else that is occupying my time. My goal is to write one blog post every two weeks. Hopefully, I’m not all over the place with these blog posts and can both learn and teach through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I will be sharing some of my photography through the background images of this blog.
